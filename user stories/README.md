# ðŸ§¾ User Stories â€“ Airbnb Clone

This directory contains documented user stories that describe how users interact with the core features of the Airbnb Clone backend.

Each user story is written from the perspective of a Guest, Host, or Admin and helps guide the implementation of backend functionalities such as:

- User registration and authentication
- Property listing and management
- Searching and booking properties
- Payment processing
- Reviews and ratings
- Admin management tools

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

User stories help developers and stakeholders understand:
- What the user needs
- Why the feature is important
- The expected outcome

These stories are derived from the Use Case Diagram and are part of the ALX Airbnb Clone system design documentation.
